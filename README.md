# FEMA OCTO Virtual Partnering with US Forest Service Technology Exchange - Fall 2022

Welcome to FEMA's Office of the Chief Technology Officer repository for the Fall 2022 Virtual Technology Exchange focusing on Partnering with US Forest Service!

## Participant Feedback & Contributions

For the participants in the FEMA-S22 Technology Exchange that have files, white papers, suggestions, solution samples, demos, code, or other technological responses you wish to be considered, create a repository under your own GitHub account and **tag it with the "fema-s22" or "fema-s22-partnering-with-US-forest-service" topic**. See the GitHub document [Classifying Your Repository with Topics](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/classifying-your-repository-with-topics). This will facilitate monitoring of the social conversation around the “fema-f22” GitHub topic tag following the event.


Enable the [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/quickstart) feature within your repository to promote conversations around solutions or posted material. Only general discussions should occur within this FEMA repository.

When considering non-code files for your repositories, we prefer open, text-based formats (PDF, PowerPoint, Word, Excel files may not be reviewed by FEMA). Image files such as PNG or JPG are also acceptable.
